# 🎙️ Voice AI Assistant – Energy Consumption Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a technical challenge.

It is a voice-enabled AI assistant built with Python that:

- Captures audio directly from the browser
- Converts audio format for speech recognition
- Uses OpenAI API for transcription (Speech-to-Text)
- Generates contextual responses using structured energy consumption data
- Simulates a corporate AI assistant for an energy monitoring company
